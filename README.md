codegorilla week 2: first exercise with OOP

Step 1:
- Create a class (Animal), with two subclasses(Bird, Insect)
- Create one instance of each sublass.
- Test both intances by using all properties and methodes 
  (including the properties and methods defined in the parent class)

Step 2:
- Randomly create n objects:
  50% change if it is a Bird-object / 50% chance if it is an Insect-object
  For each instance all their properties must also be created randomly.
